# fitness-tracker
Creating a fitness tracker using Mongo and Express.

The purpose of this application is to create a fitness tracker that uses a database in MongoDB and Express to manage the routes going into the database.  This would allow the user to log their workouts quickly and without hassle.

*This application is still a W.I.P. hence it has not been deployed to Heroku yet.
